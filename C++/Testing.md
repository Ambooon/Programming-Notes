**Software verification** is the process of testing whether or not the software works as expected in all cases. A **unit test** is a test designed to test a small portion of the code (typically a function or call) in isolation to ensure a particular behavior occurs as expected. **Unit test frameworks** can help you organize your unit tests. **Integration testing** tests the integration of a bunch of units together to ensure they work properly.

**Code coverage** refers to how much of the source code is executed while testing. **Statement coverage** refers to the percentage of statements in a program that have been exercised by testing routines. **Branch coverage** refers to the percentage of branches that have been executed by testing routines. **Loop coverage** (also called the **0, 1, 2 test**) means that if you have a loop, you should ensure it works properly when it iterates 0 times, 1 time, and 2 times.

The **happy path** is the path of execution that occurs when there are no errors encountered. A **sad path** is one where an error or failure state occurs. A **non-recoverable error** (also called a **fatal error**) is an error that is severe enough that the program can’t continue running. A program that handles error cases well is **robust**.
